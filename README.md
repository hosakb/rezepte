This repository contains JS Code for my Apple Shortcut Project. I keep my favorite cooking recipes in three Notion databases. Since it can get quite tedious to add the ingredients and amounts for multiple recipes, to the Bring! shopping list app, I wanted to automate this process. The code consumes the official Notion API for parsing the recipes, as well as the unofficial Bring! APi.
